                                        <p>As a Data Engineer at MTX Group, I developed innovative solutions that enabled teams across the organization to access and analyze large datasets for both real-time and batch processing. This role allowed me to blend my expertise in AWS and open-source technologies, crafting architectures that balanced performance and cost-efficiency. I took pride in enhancing the accessibility of analytics by automating ETL workflows with Python and AWS, reducing processing times and eliminating manual tasks. Additionally, I established a framework of data integrity through role-based access, encryption, and robust monitoring practices, creating a secure foundation for data-driven insights. My experience here has been transformative, as I integrated CI/CD best practices to maintain high-quality, streamlined deployments across our pipelines.</p>

                                        <p>During my tenure at Logic Square, I honed my skills in building resilient, scalable data solutions tailored to complex requirements. My work focused on automating ETL processes using AWS services like Glue, Kinesis, and Lambda to support real-time data transformations. This experience helped me drive significant efficiency gains, with processing times reduced and data retrieval made faster. I also embraced a security-first approach, implementing IAM roles and integrating metadata with Glue Data Catalog to create a secure and user-friendly data architecture. Working with external APIs and Redshift analytics, I was able to generate insights that empowered decision-making. These experiences laid the groundwork for a deeper understanding of AWS technologies and how to maximize their potential in real-world applications.</p>
